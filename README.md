# Read Me!

## If you got here via Google Classroom:

### Don't worry! It's alright! This place lets you check the code for the project, and look at it in an open source view! Pretty cool, right?

## If you got here via somewhere else/Github

### Welcome! This is a website that I programmed myself for a school project. I thought I'd make it open source because this was my most ambitious project in web development yet. (1w 3d) It's a project about Ancient Egypt's mummification.

## How to open the site

### It's not hard. Open index.html. Ugh, you still cant figure it out? Check out the help video in the file below:

## Have fun!

#### hint hint: if you're new to the whole github thing, it's very simple if you want the files. on the page where it shows elements, help, and the README file, click ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81582497/154125817-39af0c85-cd6e-480f-851e-f0b5e12b9e01.png), and click ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81582497/154125861-df361370-d6c7-4b7f-bfa5-b0eff9a01161.png) . Then, you can unzip that file, and access all that cool stuff! Like I said, if you don't know how to open it, watch the video!
