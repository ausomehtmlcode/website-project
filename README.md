# Read Me!

## If you got here via Google Classroom:

### Don't worry! It's alright! This place lets you check the code for the project, and look at it in an open source view! Pretty cool, right?

## If you got here via somewhere else/Github

### Welcome! This is a website that I programmed myself for a school project. I thought I'd make it open source because this was my most ambitious project in web development yet. (1w 3d) It's a project about Ancient Egypt's mummification.

## How to open the site

### It's not hard. Open index.html. Ugh, you still cant figure it out? Check out the help video in the file below:

## Have fun!

#### hint hint: if you're new to the whole github thing, it's very simple if you want the files. on the page where it shows elements, help, and the README file, click the green button that says code, and click download ZIP. Then, you can unzip that file, and access all that cool stuff! Like I said, if you don't know how to open it, watch the video!
