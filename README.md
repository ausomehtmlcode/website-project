## If you got here via Google Classroom:

### Don't worry! It's alright! This place lets you check the code for the project, and look at it in an open source view! Pretty cool, right?

## If you got here via somewhere else/Github

### Welcome! This is a website that I programmed myself for a school project. I thought I'd make it open source because this was my most ambitious project in web development yet. (1w 3d) It's a project about Ancient Egypt's mummification.

## How to open the site

### It's not hard. Open index.html. Ugh, you still cant figure it out? Check out the help video in the file below:

## Have fun!

#### hint hint: if you're new to the whole github thing, it's very simple if you want the files. on the page where it shows elements, help, and the README file, click ![Screenshot 2022-02-15 1 28 31 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81582497/154126398-437d8f9d-669b-4830-9161-231dbc23b1fd.png), and click ![Screenshot 2022-02-15 1 28 58 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81582497/154126459-65f84cf8-fcb1-4644-b8d7-b18a854d2d66.png). Then, you can unzip that file, and access all that cool stuff! Like I said, if you don't know how to open it, watch the video!
